Project structure is based on standard react-native-router-flux npm modules.
First entry point is Entry.js located into /project/components/ directory, and Entry.js leads navigator and activities. 
First screen is /components/Introduction.js and while user tap get started button, it leads into /components/Sign.js and Register.js. 
All of screen and js files are dummy code right now.
